    <h2>Fancy output example</h2>

<p>These output routines use the R2HTML package by Eric Lecoutre. The
output styling can be changed easily be switching or modifying a CSS
file. Data frames are output as
nicely formatted tables. Pretty much any object can be displayed as
HTML just by enclosing it with <code>HTML()</code>. Use
<code>HTMLon()</code> to switch to HTML output (the default is text output).</p>

<p>With Internet Explorer, you can also
copy and paste the table output into Excel or other table-like
application. </p>

<p>These output tables are also sortable by
clicking on the column header. It
uses the tablesort.htc routine (http://goblet.molgen.mpg.de/moz-behaviors-example/findex.html). This feature works in Internet
Explorer and Mozilla, but for large tables, it's quite a bit slower in
Moz:(. </p>

<h3>Data frame output examples</h3>

    <div class="Rpad_input" rpad_type="R">
      data(iris)<br>
      data = iris<br>
      cat("\nSortable table (click the headings):")<br>
      HTMLon()<br>
      HTML(data[1:5,])<br>
      HTML(summary(data))<br>
    </div>

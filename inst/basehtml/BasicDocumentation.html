      <h2>Rpad</h2>

      <p>Rpad is an interactive, web-based analysis program. Rpad pages
      are interactive workbook-type sheets based on R, an open-source
      implementation of the S language. Rpad is an analysis package, a
      web-page designer, and a gui designer all wrapped in one. Rpad
      makes it easy to develop powerful data analysis applications that
      can be shared with others (most likely on an intranet). The user
      doesn't have to install anything--everything's done through a
      browser.</p>

      <p>From the user's point of view, Rpad shouldn't really need any
      documentation. It just looks like a web page. The user can run a
      pre-canned analysis and poke around with the inputs and scripts
      and outputs. For designers of Rpad pages, some more background is
      helpful.</p>

  <p>Rpad is available in two versions: a local
  version and an intranet/internet version. The local version works
  through the user's local installation of R with through the user's web
  browser. The intranet/internet
  version works in client-server fashion with the user accessing a remote
  server through a standard web browser.</p>

      <h2>Browser Support: Mozilla and IE</h2>

      <p>Rpad is most mature on Internet Explorer. It's been tested on
      version 6.0 and may work in 5.5 (untested). The main advantage of
      IE is more mature support of WYSIWYG editing. IE has many
      negatives though: the html that the editor generates is awful,
      the browser is inferior to Mozilla browser in many
      ways, and it's Windows-only.</p>

      <p>Rpad works with Mozilla (tested on v1.5) and with Firefox
      (tested on v1.0) with the <a
      href='http://mozile.mozdev.org'>Mozile</a> extension <a
      href='http://downloads.mozdev.org/mozile/'>[downloads]</a>. Rpad pages
      will work without the Mozile extension, but the pages are
      "read-only" -- none of the page is editable. But, the user can
      still enter data in input boxes and operate GUI widgets and
      calculate the page. If all editable areas are kept as INPUT's or
      TEXTAREA's, then such pages should work fine even without
      WYSIWYG editing capability. Mozile adds the contentEditable
      feature to allow editing of anything on the page. This works
      pretty well, but Mozile is beta software and is not quite as
      smooth as the IE contentEditable. While Mozilla support is still somewhat
      immature, it should be great as it matures.</p>

	<p>Rpad actually has two editors, one based on HTMLArea, and a
	"lite" editor that doesn't use HTMLArea (but it does use some
	utility routines taken from HTMLArea). The lite editor is
	especially useful with Mozilla browsers. The lite editor does not
	embed an Iframe, so some things work better (like internal links
	in Rpad pages). Startup should be
	faster as well. The lite editor is the default on Mozilla
	browsers, but it can also be used in IE (you need to change the
	first line in Rpad_loader.js). Likewise, you can use the HTMLArea
	editor with Mozilla by changing Rpad_loader.js, but many of the
	buttons on the HTMLArea toolbar won't work (but the buttons on the
	Mozile toolbar still should work.</p>

 <p>HTMLArea has options for many plugins that can
      also be used with Rpad. Extra capabilities include better table
      support and context menu options.</p>

      <p>Rpad doesn't work on other browsers (Opera, konquerer, etc.).
      To work, a browser needs the contentEditable feature, and it needs xmlHttp.</p>

      <h2>Editing and Running</h2>

      <p>The whole page is editable as a simple WYSIWYG html editor.</p>

      <p>The simplest way to set up a page is to use one or more Rpad
      script regions. Scripts can be inside of div, span, or textareas.
      Scripts can be R, shell, or javascript. Server-side shell scripts
      are useful for using other scripting or command-lines (python,
      octave, imagemagik, and so on). Javascript is useful for local
      processing, interactivity, or for debugging Rpad problems.</p>

      <p>To "run" or "calculate" a page, press the F9 key or use the
      mouse to press the "Calculate" menu option. If you want to
      "calculate" just one region, press F8 when in the Rpad_input
      region or the Rpad_results region (this has no menu option). All
      scripts are run from top to bottom. There is no
      automatic cross-referencing like a spreadsheet. While a web page is up, Rpad is
      communicating with the same R process. That means all the
      variables are still there (even if you change the script). This
      can have some desirable or undesirable effects, so it's good to
      be aware of it. Refreshing the page (make sure to save first)
      will restart the R process.</p>

      <p>Scripts can be hidden from the user. Press F2 to toggle
      between hidden and revealed Rpad_input sections. There's also a
      menu option to reveal all hidden scripts.</p>

      <p>A special type of Rpad_input section is executed just at
      startup. These sections have rpad_run="init" set in the html
      codes. For now, there's no gui to specify this. You either have
      to enter this code directly in the html (via the &lt;&gt; toolbar
      button), copy and paste it from another Rpad page, or use another
      text editor to add this. These "init" blocks are useful for
      reading in files or data and also for setting up GUI elements
      from server data (they only run once, so the user can change the
      GUI elements generated on the server). If rpad_run="none", then
      the script doesn't run until the user explicitly calculates that
      block. This is also useful in some situations.</p>

      <p>Rpad output sections are normally rendered as plain text with
      a fixed-width font, so text script outputs are formatted
      properly. The output blocks can also contain HTML codes for
      displaying images or for formatted blocks. To change to HTML
      formatting send '<htmlon/>' to the output. This is
      cat('<htmlon/>') in R scripts. To turn HTML mode off, send '<htmloff/>'.</p>

      <h2>Rpad package</h2>

      <p>The Rpad package provides several R utility routines to help
      the user do graphs and generate HTML output and HTML GUI
      elements. </p>

      <h2>GUIs</h2>

      <p>There are several ways to add interactivity to an Rpad page.
      From simplest to complex, some possibilities are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Rpad GUI tools --</em> Through the Rpad menu, you can
        add links, checkboxes, and radio buttons.</li>

        <li><em>Copy and paste</em> -- You can paste widgets from other
        web pages or other web-page design programs.</li>

        <li><em>Handmade</em> -- You can hand enter the html or use
        other html design programs to generate more complex widgets,
        including javascript if needed.</li>

        <li><em>R generation --</em> For more complex entries or when
        the gui element is based on server-side data, it is easier to
        generate the GUI elements on the server.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The basic GUI elements that are "named" are translated into
      variables with the same name in R. The variable name appears in a
      box on the upper right of this window when you select a GUI
      element. </p>

      <h2>HTML File Structure</h2>

      <p>You can turn any HTML file into an editable Rpad page. Simply
      insert the following code into the page header:</p>
<pre>
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;editor/Rpad_loader.js&quot;&gt;
</pre>

      <p>Within the body of an HTML file, any element can be tagged
      with 'style="Rpad_input"'. Normally, this is either a div (fills
      the width of the element) or a span (which can be used within a
      paragraph), but textarea and input are also useful. </p>

      <p>There are several kinds of Rpad_input variations. The tag
      'Rpad_type' specifies the options, which include:</p>

<dl>
<dt>R</dt><dd>R scripts of course</dd>  
<dt>Rvariable</dt><dd>R expression assigned to a variable</dd>  
<dt>Rstring</dt><dd>R string</dd>  
<dt>shellscript</dt><dd>server shell script</dd>  
<dt>javascript</dt><dd>local javascript interpreter</dd>  
</dl>

<p>Another option available on Rpad_input blocks is
rpad_run="init". With this, the script will only run when the page
first loads and not after (unless the user explicitly requests
calculation by hitting F8). Another option is rpad_run="all" where the
block runs initially and every time the page is calculated.</p>

<p>Another optional tag available on Rpad_input blocks is
rpad_output, which has options of 'none', 'html', or the default
'text'. 'html' and 'text' determine how the output is
interpretted. Within an R block, the formatting can be switched by HTMLon()
or HTMLoff(). There is no GUI to adjust this yet.</p>

<p>HTML GUI elements (input, select, radio, and checkbox)
with a name tag are automatically sent to R when
calculate is run. The 'name' is translated into an R variable
name. To make the GUI elements selectable must be surrounded by &lt;span
contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (also for url links and buttons). </p>

<p>Here is an example of a complete Rpad HTML file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;GUI Examples&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;editor/Rpad_loader.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;span contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;isPepperoni&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Pepperoni &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;span contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input class=&quot;Rpad_input&quot; name=&quot;favoriteNumber&quot;rpad_type=&quot; Rvariable&quot; value=&quot;44&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;Favorite number&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;Rpad_input&quot; rpad_type=&quot;R&quot; rpad_run=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
      HTMLon()&lt;br/&gt;
      data(state)&lt;br/&gt;
      select(&quot;favoriteAmericanState&quot;, state.name) # generate the select box
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;Rpad_input&quot; rpad_type=&quot;R&quot;&gt;
      cat(&quot;isPepperoni=&quot;,isPepperoni,&quot;\n&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;
      cat(&quot;favoriteAmericanState=&quot;,favoriteAmericanState,&quot;\n&quot;)
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>In Rpad_input
sections, everything must be valid HTML,
so <code>"&lt;-"</code> must be <code>"&amp;lt;-"</code>. Also, &lt;br/&gt; tags are needed for line breaks, except for textarea sections. </p>

<p>You can use a &lt;PRE&gt; tag to make the HTML easier as
follows. This makes it easier to paste R code into an HTML file: you
don't need to use &lt;br/&gt;'s to separate lines, and whitespace is
preserved. One disadvantage is that Mozile (the editing plugin for
Mozilla) is a little buggy when editing PRE sections, so the user
might get a little confused (the cursor doesn't work right all of the time).</p>

<pre>
  &lt;div class=&quot;Rpad_input&quot; rpad_type=&quot;R&quot; rpad_run=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
    &lt;pre&gt;
      HTMLon()
      data(state)
      select(&quot;favoriteAmericanState&quot;, state.name) # generate the select box
    &lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

</pre>



      <h2>Server Setup in the Client/Server Version</h2>

      <p>The files in Rpad are layed out as follows on the server:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>/Rpad -- The main *.html pages and data go here.</li>

        <li>/Rpad/editor -- This has the Rpad javascript GUI stuff,
        including HTMLArea.</li>

        <li>/Rpad/server -- This has the Perl server-side scripts.</li>

        <li>/Rpad/server/ddXXXXXXXX -- When Rpad scripts are run,
        they're run from temporary directories under the /Rpad/server
        directory.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In Rpad scripts, although you can access files in the main directory (the
      directory of the page) with "../../whatever", you are better off
      using <code>RpadBaseFile("whatever")</code> to maintain
      compatibility with the local version of Rpad. You can access
      files in the R process's current directory as you would
      normally, but if you want to specify it as a URL for output in
      the browser (for a link or an embedded file), use <code>RpadBaseURL("whatever")</code>.</p>

      <p>In the client/server version, each Rpad page gets its own R process on the server, so it is
      rather resource intensive. Threading and Duncan Temple Lang's
<a href="http://developer.r-project.org/TODO-DTL.html">idea</a> of "multiple interpreters" would greatly
help reduce the resource usage on the server. </p>

      <h2>Browser-Server Communications</h2>

      <p>Rpad uses Xmlhttp to communicate between the browser and the
      server, so browser refreshes are not needed to update data. This
      is available for both Mozilla and IE. Rpad uses standard HTTP
      GET or PUT requests, and all
      data is transmitted as ascii. Xmlhttp allows both synchronous
      and asynchronous communications. The best implementation (I've
      tried both) appears to be asynchronous. Synchronous
      communications can lock up the browser for long periods if the
      server becomes unavailable, or there's a communications
      glitch. Asynchronous communication avoids this, but the logic is
      more contorted internally.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>

      <p>There is no built in security in Rpad. The user has complete
      access to any command in R and also in the system shell. I
      consider this a feature, not a bug. For protection, the system
      needs to be locked down on the server. Write protect any files
      and databases that are a concern, and lock out access to the
      server user to other parts of the system.</p>

      <p>With the base setup, Rpad users can stomp on each others
      files. If a user saves a file in the Rpad directory, another user
      can write over it. To make it more permanent, the user would have
      to request that the system administrator write protect the file
      and any data that went with the file.</p>

      <p>Because of the relatively lax security, Rpad is best
      suited for intranets or other relatively controlled
      situations.</p>

      <p>Rpad could be integrated into a more advanced content
      management system that would better handle multiple users,
      passwords, and so on.</p>

      <h2>Server Installation</h2>

      <p>For notes on server installations, click <a href="ServerNotes.html">here</a>.</p>

      <h2>Differences Between the Local Version and the Client/Server Version</h2>

      <p>In the client/server version, each Rpad page gets its own R
      process on the server. So, multiple user's won't interfere with
      each other. In the local version of Rpad, the browser
      connects with one R process, so there is more chance of
      interaction between multiple Rpad pages. Each time the user
      starts a new page in the client-server version, the local
      environment is clean. But in the local version of Rpad,
      this is not true: the local environment may have objects from
      previous Rpad pages or from interaction at the command line. </p> 

      <p>There are several differences in directory layouts between
      the local and client-server versions of Rpad. In the local
      version, the current working directory of the R process is the
      directory of the Rpad page. In the client-server version, the
      current directory of the R process is two levels below the Rpad
      page (something like /var/www/Rpad/server/ddjieyfewx/ for files
      with a root of /var/www/Rpad/). In both versions, graphics are
      created in R's current working directory. But pages may read or
      write data differently depending on whether in the local or
      client-server version. See the Rpad functions RpadURL,
      RpadBaseURL, and RpadBaseFile for convenience utilities to make
      pages portable between the local version and the client-server
      verstion.</p>

      <p>In the local version of Rpad, the default graphics device is
      R's builtin png device. On the client-server version, the
      default graphics device is the ghostscript-based pngalpha
      device. Therefore, graphic files may look different between
      versions. The pngalpha device has the advantage that it is
      antialiased, you can link to an eps file, and you have more
      fonts. The disadvantages of the pngalpha device are that you
      have to have ghostscript installed, and it's slower. On the
      server side, if you want to use R's png device on unix, you
      must have X running.  </p>

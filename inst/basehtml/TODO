Here are some ideas for improvements to Rpad. Many of these are from
Eric Lecoutre.

(*) TOGGLE EDITING -- Toggle between an editable version and a
run-only version. I am sure this goes on the other way of your
approach. Hide all the upper interface (hide only menu or hide menu 
AND format toolbar).

(*) PDF GRAPHIC LINK OPTION -- Allow the user to download a PDF file
when the PNG graphic is clicked. 



LONGER-TERM IDEAS {meaning they're harder}

(*) POPUPS -- Find a good toolkit that does popup windows. Then we can
create gui's for things like adding a button (where the user has to
enter more data than an alert will allow). It would also be nice to
have a popup showing status of server connections (loading, sending
scripts to the server, and so on).

(*) BETTER MENUS -- I'd like a menu bar that you could use with the
keyboard. 

(*) GENERAL TOOLKIT -- Maybe someone will develop a good general
purpose javascript GUI toolkit that we can use for the Rpad GUI as
well as in Rpad pages. netwindows.org looks promising. The work of the
whatWG is also promising.

(*) FILE UPLOAD -- Add capability to upload data files. I thought this
would be easy at first, but while XMLHttp can transmit data,
javascript can't arbitrarily access files on the user's computer. You
might be able to build a form in a hidden frame and submit the form (I
don't know how to do that on either the browser or server side).

(*) EMACS Rpad MODE -- It would be nice to have a mode that could
syntax highlight HTML, javascript, and R code all in the same Rpad
file.
